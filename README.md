# is_triangle


In this program, we give the code to find out wheter any triple of positive real numbers represents a triangle or not. 

The essential criteria to be able to define a triangle is the length of one side can NOT exceed the sum of the other two sides.
We define a function of "is_triangle_ and it returns the triples if they define such triangles.  

To execute the code Python 3.x version is required but it can be easily converted to Python 2.x.
