# Is Triangle

We gave the code to find out wheter any triple of positive real numbers represents a triangle or not. 

## Project Description

The essential criteria to be able to define a triangle is the length of one side can NOT exceed the sum of the other two sides. We define a function of "is_triangle_ and it returns the triples if they define such triangles.  

## Execution

To execute the program, you need to have Python 3.x and an editor. If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.X installer and not the Python 2.7 installer but it can be easily converted to Python 2.&.
